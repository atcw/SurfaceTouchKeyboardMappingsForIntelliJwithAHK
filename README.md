# SurfaceTouchKeyboardMappingsForIntelliJwithAHK  
  
Needs https://www.autohotkey.com/ to run.
 
Useful for IntelliJ on Windows-Notebooks (Especially Surface Pro 4/5)  
especiallly if you don't have a right Control-Key but do have an App-Key.  
 
Remaps the AppsKey aka RightClick-Key or Menu-Key that looks like the Hamburger  
Menu Button found on Websites [â˜°] to 3 different Functions:  
 
## Long-Press: 
 * "Control-Key" 
## Single-Press: 
 * Normal AppKey-Functions  
## Double-Press: 
 * IntelliJ Comment Out Code with Line-Comment which normally needs the NumpadDiv.  
	(Todo: Combine with Shift for Block-Comment)  
## Hold CapsLock:  
 * Peek through the current window which becomes transparent and you can even click through  
 
# Known Bugs: 
CTRL-State hangs sometimes after Appskey, if a window is opened via the app-menu.
