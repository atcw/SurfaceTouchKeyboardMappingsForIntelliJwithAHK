; SurfaceTouchKeyboardMappingsForIntelliJAHK
;
; Useful for IntelliJ on Notebooks (Especially Surface Pro 4/5)
; Remaps the AppsKey (aka RightClick-Key or Menu-Key) to 3 different Functions
; Long-Press: "Control-Key" because there no control-key on the right side
; Single-Press: Normal AppKey-Functions
; Double-Press: IntelliJ Comment Out Code which normally needs the NumpadDiv. 
;				(Todo: Combine with Shift at your leisure.)
; Press CapsLock: 
;				Peek through the current window which becomes transparent and you can even click through
; Known Bugs: CTRL-State hangs after Appskey, if a window is opened via the app-menu.
